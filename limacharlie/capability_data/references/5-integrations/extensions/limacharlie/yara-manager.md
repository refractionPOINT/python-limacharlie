# YARA Manager

The [YARA](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules) manager Extension allows you to reference external YARA rules (rules maintained in GitHub, for example) to use in your YARA scans within LimaCharlie.

YARA rule sources defined in the YARA manager configuration will be synced every 24 hours, and can be manually synced by clicking the `Manual Sync` button on the extension page.

If you add rule sources and want them to become available immediately, you will need to click the `Manual Sync` button to trigger the initial sync of the rules.

Rule sources can be either direct links (URLs) to a given YARA rule or [ARLs](../../../8-reference/authentication-resource-locator.md).

## Option 1: Predefined YARA rules

LimaCharlie provides a list of YARA rule repositories, available in the configuration menu. To leverage these rules select "Predefined" and a list of LimaCharlie and Community rules will populate. By selecting one or more of these repositories, the respective rules will be automatically imported and will appear in your YARA rules under Automation → YARA Rules.

## Option 2: Publicly available YARA rules

An example of setting up a rule using this repo: [Yara-Rules](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules)

For an `Email and General Phishing Exploit` rule we could use the following URL, which is a link to a single YARA rule.

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yara-Rules/rules/master/email/Email_generic_phishing.yar>

For creating a rule out of multiple YARA rules, we could use the following ARL, which is a link to a directory of YARA rules.

`[github,Yara-Rules/rules/email]`

Giving the rule configuration a name, the URL or ARL, and clicking the Save button will create the new rule source to sync to your YARA rules.

## Option 3: Private YARA Repository

To use a YARA rule from a private Gihub repository you will need to make use of an [Authentication Resource Locator](../../../8-reference/authentication-resource-locator.md).

**Step 1: Create a token in GitHub**
In GitHub go to *Settings* and click *Developer settings* in the left hand side bar.

Next click *Personal access token* followed by *Generate new token*. Select repo permissions and finally *Generate token*.

**Step 2: Connect LimaCharlie to your GitHub repository**
Inside of LimaCharlie, click on *Yara Manager* in the left hand menu. Then click *Add New Yara Configuration*.

Give your rule a name and then use the token you generated with the following format linked to your repo.

`[github,my-org/my-repo-name/path/to/rule.yar,token,bfuihferhf8erh7ubhfey7g3y4bfurbfhrb]`

or

`[github,my-org/my-repo-name/path/to/rules_directory,token,bfuihferhf8erh7ubhfey7g3y4bfurbfhrb]`

LimaCharlie Extensions allow users to expand and customize their security environments by integrating third-party tools, automating workflows, and adding new capabilities. Organizations subscribe to Extensions, which are granted specific permissions to interact with their infrastructure. Extensions can be private or public, enabling tailored use or broader community sharing. This framework supports scalability, flexibility, and secure, repeatable deployments.
