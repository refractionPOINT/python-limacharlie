# Detection and response rules

First choose the evaluation surface: ordinary telemetry/automation D&R, email verdict (`dr-mail`), or cloud posture (`cloudsec_policy`). Load email-security or cloud-security for those specialized rules; shared detect syntax does not imply shared envelopes, paths, operators or response actions.

For ordinary D&R, establish rule namespace and target. The default target is `edr`; alternate targets include detection, deployment, artifact, artifact_event, schedule, audit and billing. Their event structure and permitted actions differ. A detection-target event name is the originating report name. Inspect a real representative event and schema, then read the relevant operator and action documentation. Match the correct field level (`event/`, `routing/`, or target-specific root). Use `scope` when conditions must match one array element. Verify string case, regex fields and missing-field behavior against the operator reference.

External rule conversion through `dr convert-rules` must use dry-run; deploy converted candidates individually through the artifact workflow. Author the smallest rule meeting the request. AI generation is an optional drafting helper; generated content needs the same validation. Preserve enabled status, namespace and unrelated metadata when editing. Check existing rules for overlapping matches and avoid response loops, especially rules responding to detections or audit events they create. Bound repeated responses using documented suppression/stateful mechanisms.

Build one full Hive envelope before validation: `data` contains `detect`, `respond` and other rule fields; `usr_mtd` includes an explicit boolean `enabled` and the intended metadata. For an existing rule, first read the same namespace/key, preserve every existing metadata field unless deliberately changing it, and copy `sys_mtd.etag` into the candidate's top-level `etag` for compare-and-swap protection. A concurrent change requires a fresh read and reconciliation, not an unconditional overwrite. A new rule still needs explicit enabled state. Bare detect/respond objects can be tested, but cannot complete deployment.

Use `limacharlie dr deploy --key NAME --input-file candidate.json --positive matching.json --negative nonmatching.json --oid OID --output json`. The command compiles, runs both fixtures, reads and checks current metadata/etag, applies the exact loaded candidate, and verifies read-back. Add `--dry-run` to inspect the candidate and existing record without writing. Dry-run is optional when the user has already authorized the exact change. Fixture files must be nonempty JSON arrays. The command always reruns validation and tests; changing any input cannot reuse stale evidence. Inspect structured checks and require `status: verified`. Do not bypass through raw dr set/import or Hive writes. Each fixture is one event sequence; representative fixture selection remains your responsibility.

If historical replay is appropriate, set an explicit time/sensor scope, inspect its estimate or limits where available, and track the returned job to completion. Historical volume is not an exact future cost forecast.

Deploy the exact tested artifact, then read it back from the same namespace and check enabled state. Changes after testing invalidate previous test evidence. Distinguish saved, enabled, evaluated and observed firing. When no safe live trigger exists, say the deployment is verified but live firing has not been observed. FP suppressions need narrow predicates and a negative control showing unrelated detections survive.
