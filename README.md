# LimaCharlie.io CLI and Python API

![LimaCharlie.io](https://storage.googleapis.com/limacharlie-io/logo_fast_glitch.gif)

This Python library is a simple abstraction to the LimaCharlie.io REST API.

For more information on LimaCharlie.io: [https://limacharlie.io](https://limacharlie.io).

## Documentation
* Python API Doc: https://python-limacharlie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* General LimaCharlie Doc: https://doc.limacharlie.io/
* REST API: [https://api.limacharlie.io](https://api.limacharlie.io)

## Getting Started
The Python API uses the LimaCharlie.io REST API. The REST API currently
supports many more functions. If the Python is missing a function available
in the REST API that you would like to use, let us know at support@limacharlie.io.

### Installing
`pip install limacharlie`

### Credentials
Authenticating to use the SDK / CLI can be done in a few ways.

#### Logging In
The simplest is to login to an organization using an [API key](https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/api_keys.md).

Use `limacharlie login` to store credentials locally. You will need an `OID` (Organization ID) and an API key, both
of which you can get from the "REST API" section of the web interface.

The login interface supports named environments, or a default one used when no environment is selected.

To list available environments: `limacharlie use`.

Setting a given environment in the current shell session can be done like: `. <(limacharlie use dev-org)`.

You can also specify a `UID` (User ID) during login to use a *user* API key representing
the total set of permissions that user has (see User Profile in the web interface).

#### Environment Variables
You can use the `LC_OID` and `LC_API_KEY` and `LC_UID` environment variables to replace
the values used logging in. The environment variables will be used if no other credentials
are specified.

## SDK

The root of the functionality in the SDK is from the `Manager` object. It holds the crendentials
and is tied to a specific Organization.

You can authenticate the `Manager` using an `oid` (and optionally a `uid`), along with either
a `secret_api_key` or `jwt` directly. Alternatively you can just use an environment name (as specified
in `limacharlie login`). If no creds are provided, the `Manager` will try to use the default environment
and credentials.

### Importing
```python
import limacharlie

YARA_SIG = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yara-Rules/rules/master/Malicious_Documents/Maldoc_PDF.yar'

# Create an instance of the SDK.
man = limacharlie.Manager()

# Get a list of all the sensors in the current Organization.
all_sensors = man.sensors()

# Select the first sensor in the list.
sensor = all_sensors[ 0 ]

# Tag this sensor with a tag for 10 minutes.
sensor.tag( 'suspicious', ttl = 60 * 10 )

# Send a task to the sensor (unidirectionally, not expecting a response).
sensor.task( 'os_processes' )

# Send a yara scan to that sensor for processes "evil.exe".
sensor.task( 'yara_scan -e *evil.exe ' + YARA_SIG )
```

### Use of gevent
Note that the SDK uses the `gevent` package which sometimes has issues with other
packages that operate at a low level in python. For example, Jupyter notebooks
may see freezing on importing `limacharlie` and require a tweak to load:

```json
{
 "display_name": "IPython 2 w/gevent",
 "language": "python",
 "argv": [
  "python",
  "-c", "from gevent.monkey import patch_all; patch_all(thread=False); from ipykernel.kernelapp import main; main()",
  "-f",
  "{connection_file}"
 ]
}
```

### Components
#### Manager
This is a the general component that provides access to the managing functions
of the API like querying sensors online, creating and removing Outputs etc.

#### Firehose
The `Firehose` is a simple object that listens on a port for LimaCharlie.io data.
Under the hood it creates a Syslog Output on limacharlie.io pointing to itself
and removes it on shutdown. Data from limacharlie.io is added to `firehose.queue`
(a `gevent Queue`) as it is received.

It is a basic building block of automation for limacharlie.io.

#### Spout
Much like the `Firehose`, the Spout receives data from LimaCharlie.io, the difference
is that the `Spout` does not require opening a local port to listen actively on. Instead
it leverages `stream.limacharlie.io` to receive the data stream over HTTPS.

A `Spout` is automatically created when you instantiate a `Manager` with the
`is_interactive = True` and `inv_id = XXXX` arguments in order to provide real-time
feedback from tasking sensors.

#### Sensor
This is the object returned by `manager.sensor( sensor_id )`.

It supports a `task`, `hostname`, `tag`, `untag`, `getTags` and more functions. This
is the main way to interact with a specific sensor.

The `task` function sends a task to the sensor unidirectionally, meaning it does not
receive the response from the sensor (if any). If you want to interact with a sensor
in real-time, use the interactive mode (as mentioned in the `Spout`) and use either
the `request` function to receive replies through a `FutureResults` object or the
`simpleRequest` to wait for the response and receive it as a return value.

#### Artifacts
The `Artifacts` is a helpful class to upload [Artifact Collection](https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/external_logs.md)
to LimaCharlie without going through a sensor.

#### Payloads
The `Payloads` can be used to manage various executable [payloads](https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/payloads.md)
accessible to sensors.

#### Replay
The `Replay` object allows you to interact with [Replay](https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/replay.md)
jobs managed by LimaCharlie. These allow you to re-run [D&R Rules](https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/dr.md)
on historical data.

#### Search
The `Search` object allows you to perform an IOC search across multiple organizations.

#### SpotCheck
The `SpotCheck` object (sometimes called Fleet Check) allows you to manage an active (query sensors directly
as opposed to searching on indexed historical data) search for various IOCs on an organization's sensors.

#### Configs
The `Configs` is used to retrieve an organization's configuration as a config file, or apply
an existing config file to an organization. This is the concept of Infrastructure As Code.

#### Webhook
The `Webhook` object demonstrates handling webhooks emited by the LimaCharlie cloud, including
verifying the shared-secret signing of the webhooks.

### Examples:
* [Basic Manager Operations](samples/demo_manager.py)
* [Basic Firehose Operations](samples/demo_firehose.py)
* [Basic Spout Operations](samples/demo_spout.py)
* [Basic Integrated Operations](samples/demo_interactive_sensor.py)
* [Rules Config Syncing](limacharlie/sample_configs/)

## Command Line Interface
Many of the objects available as part of the LimaCharlie Python SDK also support various
command line interfaces.

#### Firehose
`python -m limacharlie.Firehose 1.2.3.4:9424 event -n firehose_test -t fh_test --oid c82e5c17-d519-4ef5-a4ac-caa4a95d31ca`

Listens on interface `1.2.3.4`, port `9424` for incoming connections from LimaCharlie.io.
Receives only events from hosts tagged with `fh_test`.

#### Spout
`python -m limacharlie.Spout event --oid c82e5c17-d519-4ef5-a4ac-caa4a95d31ca`

Behaves similarly to the Firehose, but instead of listenning from an internet accessible port, it
connects to the `stream.limacharlie.io` service to stream the output over HTTPS. This means the Spout
allows you to get ad-hoc output like the Firehose, but it also works through NATs and proxies.

It is MUCH more convenient for short term ad-hoc outputs, but it is less reliable than a Firehose for
very large amounts of data.

#### Configs
`limacharlie configs fetch --oid c82e5c17-d519-4ef5-a4ac-c454a95d31ca`

`limacharlie configs push --dry-run --oid c82e5c17-d519-4ef5-a4ac-c454a95d31ca`

The `fetch` command will get a list of the Detection & Response rules in your
organization and will write them to the config file specified or the default
config file `lc_conf.yaml` in YAML format.

Then `push` can upload the rules specified in the config file (or the default one)
to your organization. The optional `--force` argument will remove active rules not
found in the config file. The `--dry-run` simulates the sync and displayes the changes
that would occur.

The `--config` allows you to specify an alternate config file and the `--api-key` allows
you to specify a file on disk where the API should be read from (otherwise, of if `-` is
specified as a file, the API Key is read from STDIN).

All these capabilities are also supported directly by the `limacharlie.Configs` object.

The Sync functionality currently supports all common useful configurations. The `--no-rules` and
`--no-outputs` flags can be used to ignore one or the other in config files and sync. Additional
flags are also supported, see `limacharlie configs --help`.

To understand better the config format, do a `fetch` from your organization or have
a look at the [samples](limacharlie/sample_configs/). Notice the use of the `include`
statement. Using this statement you can combine multiple config files together, making
it ideal for the management of complex rule sets and their versioning.

#### Spot Checks
`python -m limacharlie.SpotCheck --no-macos --no-linux --tags vip --file c:\\evil.exe`

Used to perform Organization-wide checks for specific indicators of compromise. Available as a custom
API `SpotCheck` object or as a module from the command line. Supports many types of IoCs like file names,
directories, registry keys, file hashes and yara signatures.

For detailed usage: `python -m limacharlie.SpotCheck --help`
